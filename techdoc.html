            <h3>What is Git?</h3>
            <article>
            <p>Git is a Version Control System (VCS). Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time so you can recall specific version later.You can revert files (or a set of them) back to the previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something. If you screw things or lose files, you can easily recover.</p>
            <p>There's three main types of VCS: </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Local VCSs</dt>
                <dd>Local VCSs had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.</dd>
                <dt>Centralized VCSs</dt>
                <dd>One server contains all the versioned files from those who want to collaborate on the project and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. But the most obvious downside is that if the server goes down for an hour, then nobody can collaborate during that hour.</dd>
                <dt>Distributed VCSs</dt>
                <dd>To fix that issue, this is where Distributed Version Control Systems step in. In a DVCS (such as Git), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data. Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project. This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren’t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>While other systems store information as a list of file-based changes, Git thinks of its data more like a stream of snapshots of a miniature file system. Every time you save the state of your project with Git, It basically take a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. If the files have not changed, Git just link them to the previous identical files that has already stored</p>
            </article>
            <h3>Three Stages</h3>
            <article>
            <p>Git has three main states that your files can reside in:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Modified</dt>
                <dd>You have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.</dd>
                <dt>Staged</dt>
                <dd>You have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.</dd>
                <dt>Commited</dt>
                <dd>The data is safely stored in your local database.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>So, the basic Git workflow goes something like this:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You modify files in your working tree</li>
                <li>You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which <code>add</code>s «only» those changes to the staging area</li>
                <li>You do a <code>commit</code>, ehich takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot parmanently to your Git directory</li>
            </ol>
            </article>
            <p>Although the Graphic User Interfaces, we are use the classic Command-line version of Git over this documentation.If you don't what command-line is, go Google it and then back to this doc.</p>
            <h3>First-Time Git Setup</h3>
            <article>
            <p>Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment. You should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they’ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.</p>
            <p>Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different places:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt><code>/etc/gitconfig</code> file:</dt>
                <dd> Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option <code>--system</code> to <code>git config</code>, it reads and writes from this file specifically. (Because this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.)</dd>
                <dt><code>~/.gitconfig</code> or <code> ~/.config/git/config</code> fie:</dt>
                <dd>Values specific personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the <code>--global</code> option, and this affects <em>all</em> of the repositories you work with on your system.(On  Windows system, the file is in<code>C:\Users\$USER</code>)</dd>
                <dt><code>config</code> file in the Git directory(<code>.git/config</code>) of whatever repository you’re currently using: :</dt>
                <dd>Specific to that single repository. You can force Git to read from and write to this file with the <code>--local</code> option, but that is in fact the default. (Unsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.)</dd>
            </dl>
            <h4>Your Identity</h4>
            <p>The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:</p>
            <code>
                $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
            </code>
            <p>Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the <code>--global</code> option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the <code>--global</code> option when you’re in that project.</p>
            <h4>Your Editor</h4>
            <p>


If you want to use a different text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message, such as Emacs, you can do the following:

<code>$ git config --global core.editor emacs</code>

If not configured, Git uses your system’s default editor.

On a Windows system, if you want to use a different text editor, you must specify the full path to its executable file. This can be different depending on how your editor is packaged.

In the case of Notepad++, a popular programming editor, you are likely to want to use the 32-bit version, since at the time of writing the 64-bit version doesn’t support all plug-ins. If you are on a 32-bit Windows system, or you have a 64-bit editor on a 64-bit system, you’ll type something like this:

<code>$ git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"</code>

</p>
           <h4>Checking Your Settings</h4>
           <p>

If you want to check your configuration settings, you can use the git config --list command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:

<code>
$ git config --list
user.name=John Doe
user.email=johndoe@example.com
color.status=auto
color.branch=auto
color.interactive=auto
color.diff=auto
...
</code>

You may see keys more than once, because Git reads the same key from different files (<code>/etc/gitconfig</code> and <code>~/.gitconfig</code>, for example). In this case, Git uses the last value for each unique key it sees.

You can also check what Git thinks a specific key’s value is by typing <code>git config &lt;key&gt;</code>:

<code>
    $ git config user.name
John Doe
</code>
