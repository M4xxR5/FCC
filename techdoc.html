			<article>
				<p>Git is a Version Control System (VCS). Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time so you can recall specific version later.You can revert files (or a set of them) back to the previous state, compare changes
					over time, see who last modified something. If you screw things or lose files, you can easily recover.</p>
				<p>There's three main types of VCS: </p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Local VCSs</dt>
					<dd>Local VCSs had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.</dd>
					<dt>Centralized VCSs</dt>
					<dd>One server contains all the versioned files from those who want to collaborate on the project and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. But the most obvious downside is that if the server goes down for an hour, then nobody
						can collaborate during that hour.</dd>
					<dt>Distributed VCSs</dt>
					<dd>To fix that issue, this is where Distributed Version Control Systems step in. In a DVCS (such as Git), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any
						server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data. Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty
						well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project. This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren’t possible
						in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>While other systems store information as a list of file-based changes, Git thinks of its data more like a stream of snapshots of a miniature file system. Every time you save the state of your project with Git, It basically take a picture of what all
					your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. If the files have not changed, Git just link them to the previous identical files that has already stored</p>
			</article>

		<section class="main-section" id="Three_Stages">
			<header><h2>Three Stages</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>Git has three main states that your files can reside in:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Modified</dt>
					<dd>You have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.</dd>
					<dt>Staged</dt>
					<dd>You have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.</dd>
					<dt>Commited</dt>
					<dd>The data is safely stored in your local database.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>So, the basic Git workflow goes something like this:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You modify files in your working tree</li>
					<li>You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which <code>add</code>s «only» those changes to the staging area</li>
					<li>You do a <code>commit</code>, ehich takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot parmanently to your Git directory</li>
				</ol>

			<article>
				<p>Although the Graphic User Interfaces, we are use the classic Command-line version of Git over this documentation.If you don't what command-line is, go Google it and then back to this doc.</p>
				<p>Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment. You should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they’ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time
					by running through the commands again.</p>
				<p>Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different places:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><code>/etc/gitconfig</code> file:</dt>
					<dd> Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option <code>--system</code> to <code>git config</code>, it reads and writes from this file specifically. (Because this is a system configuration file,
						you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.)</dd>
					<dt><code>~/.gitconfig</code> or <code> ~/.config/git/config</code> file:</dt>
					<dd>Values specific personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the <code>--global</code> option, and this affects «all» of the repositories you work with on your system.(On Windows system,
						the file is in <code>C:\Users\$USER</code>)</dd>
					<dt><code>config</code> file in the Git directory (<code>.git/config</code>) of whatever repository you’re currently using: :</dt>
					<dd>Specific to that single repository. You can force Git to read from and write to this file with the <code>--local</code> option, but that is in fact the default. (Unsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git repository for this option
						to work properly.)</dd>
				</dl>
				<h3>Your Identity</h3>
				<p>The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:</p>
				<code class="codeblock">
                $ git config --global user.name "John Doe" <br>
                $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
            </code>
				<p>Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the <code>--global</code> option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific
					projects, you can run the command without the <code>--global</code> option when you’re in that project.</p>
				<h3>Your Editor</h3>
				<p>

					If you want to use a different text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message, such as Emacs, you can do the following:

					<code class="codeblock">$ git config --global core.editor emacs</code> If not configured, Git uses your system’s default editor. On a Windows system, if you want to use a different text editor, you must specify the full path to its executable file.
					This can be different depending on how your editor is packaged. In the case of Notepad++, a popular programming editor, you are likely to want to use the 32-bit version, since at the time of writing the 64-bit version doesn’t support all plug-ins.
					If you are on a 32-bit Windows system, or you have a 64-bit editor on a 64-bit system, you’ll type something like this:

					<code class="codeblock">$ git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"</code>

			<article>
				<p>If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it. This chapter covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git.</p>
				<p>You can obtain a Git Repository in one of two ways:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository,</li> or
					<li>You can <code>clone</code> an existing Git repository from elsewhere.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.</p>
				<h3>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory</h3>
				<p>If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project’s directory. If you’ve never done this, it looks a little different depending on which
					system you’re running:<br>For Linux: <code class="codeblock">$ cd /home/user/my_project</code><br>For macOS: <code class="codeblock">$ cd /Users/user/my_project</code><br>For Windows: <code class="codeblock">$ cd /c/user/my_project</code><br>and
					then type: <code class="codeblock">$ git init</code><br>This creates a new subdirectory named <code>.git</code> that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton.<br> If you want to start version-controlling existing
					files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few <code>git add</code> commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a <code>git commit</code>:
					<code class="codeblock">$ git add *.py<br>
            $ git add LICENSE<br>
            $ git commit -m 'initial project version'</code>We’ll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.</p>
				<h3>Cloning an Existing Repository</h3>
				<p>If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you’d like to contribute to — the command you need is <code class="codeblock">$ git clone &lt;url&gt;</code></p>. You can use <code>https://</code> protocol, <code>git://</code>,<code>user@server:path/to/repo.git</code>, as well as <code>ssh://</code>

			<header><h2>Git Branching</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>To really understand the way Git does branching, we need to take a step back and examine how Git stores its data. </p>
				<p>As you may remember from <a href="#What_is_git?">What is Git?</a>, Git doesn’t store data as a series of changesets or differences, but instead as a series of
					snapshots.</p> <p>When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged. This object also contains the author’s name and email address, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit
					or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.</p> <p>To visualize this,
					let’s assume that you have a directory containing three files, and you stage them all and commit. Staging the files computes a checksum for each one, stores that version of the file in the Git repository (Git refers to them as blobs), and adds that
					checksum to the staging area.</p> <p>When you create the commit by running <code>git commit</code>, Git checksums each subdirectory (in this case, just the root project directory) and stores them as a tree object in the Git repository. Git then creates
					a commit object that has the metadata and a pointer to the root project tree so it can re-create that snapshot when needed.</p><p>If you have 3 files, then your Git repository contains five objects: three <code>blobs</code> (each representing the contents
					of one of the three files), one <code>tree</code> that lists the contents of the directory and specifies which file names are stored as which blobs, and one <code>commit</code> with the pointer to that root tree and all the commit metadata.</p><p>If you
					make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a pointer to the commit that came immediately before it.</p><p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is <code>master</code>.
					As you start making commits, you’re given a <code>master</code> branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the <code>master</code> branch pointer moves forward automatically.
				</p>
				<h3>Creating a new branch</h3>
				<p>What happens when you create a new branch? Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move around. Let’s say you want to create a new branch called testing. You do this with the git branch command:</p>
				<code class="codeblock">$ git branch testing</code><p>This creates a new pointer to the same commit you’re currently on.</p>
